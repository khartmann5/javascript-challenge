# javascript-challenge

Using a basic `HTML` web page the data set for UFO Sightings was read in and appended to a table. Then using `JavaScript` created an event listener to search through the date/time column to find the data that matched the user input in UFO-Level-1. For UFO-Level-2 multiple input tages were created to search for UFO sightings.
